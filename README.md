Welcome to THE GAME CORNER!

This project was created as an introductury example of our first full-stack website and to get us comfortable with the front and back-end of coding. Originally the idea was to create a database that would display the routes, stops, and schedules of a bus and have that information display but as a group, we decided that it would be too much a task given the time constraints that we had. So, we decided on a database focused on video games, displaying and focusing on it's individual details as well as linking it to a device and developer. 

The intent with this video game application was not only to have the individual attributes of the video game on full display, but also to allow access and authorization to personally save favorited video games. The application was to serve as a personal library of sorts to keep track of old, current, and upcoming video games while also perserving them in a list of what was had, wished listed for, and search through based on attributes. Unfortunately, this had not come to fruition since we as a group heavily underestimated how long writing out a database would take. What did come to fruition was being able to focus on a video games attributes, which was connected to a developer, and also connected to a console. Games could also be searched via name, so users could quickly grab a video game they had already in mind.

A key lesson we as a group learned was not understimate the time and effort that goes into creating a list of data in the backend, and that validators/constraints are extremely valuable in keeping track of inaccuracies when inputting data in the database. For future reference, it may be in our best interest to instead from starting from the back-end, to flesh out the front-end to have an idea of what kind of data we want to display before committing to creating a database with tables that hold alot of attributes/keys.

Features of THE GAME CORNER!

* Search a video game by it's game.name
* Display a list of video games and it's attributes (ex, number of players, release year etc) that were provided by the back-end
* Display a list of developers (and the games created by said developer(s) when clicking on the image)
* Display a list of consoles (and the games available on the console when clicking on the image)
* The ability to add a new game via a form, while also having a default value in the event no values were added
* Homepage has logos that when clicked, displays consoles associated to the company
